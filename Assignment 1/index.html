            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p class="para">Cricket is a bat and ball game played between two teams of 11 players each. It is played
                in a ground with a pitch of 20 meters and wickets are present at both ends of the pitch. Two players
                from the batting team (the striker and nonstriker) stand in front of either wicket holding bats,
                with one player from the fielding team (the bowler) bowling the ball towards the striker's wicket
                from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and
                then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each exchange.
                Runs are also scored when the ball reaches or crosses the boundary of the field or when the ball is
                bowled illegally.The fielding team tries to prevent runs from being scored by dismissing batters (so
                they
                are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the striker's wicket and
                dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat
                but before it hits the ground or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease
                in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap
                roles. Forms of cricket range from Twenty20 (also known as T20), with each team batting for a single
                innings of 20 overs (each "over" being a set of 6 fair opportunities for the batting team to score)
                and the game generally lasting three to four hours, to Test matches played over five days.
                Traditionally, cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket, they wear
                club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent
                injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a
                slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string.</p>

            <h2 class="h2heading">Laws and Game play</h2>
            <p class="para">In cricket, the rules of the game are specified in a code called The Laws of Cricket
                (hereinafter called "the Laws"), which has a global remit. There are 42 Laws (always written
                with a capital "L"). The earliest known version of the code was drafted in 1744, and since 1788,
                it has been owned and maintained by its custodian, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London.
            </p>

            <h2 class="h2heading">Match Structure</h2>
            <p class="para">The main objective of each team is to score more runs than their opponents, but in
                some forms of cricket, it is also necessary to dismiss all but one of the opposition batters in
                their final innings in order to win the match, which would otherwise be drawn. If the team
                batting last is all out having scored fewer runs than their opponents, they are said to have
                "lost by n runs" (where n is the difference between the aggregate number of runs scored by the
                teams). If the team that bats last scores enough runs to win, it is said to have "won by n
                wickets", where n is the number of wickets left to fall. For example, a team that passes its
                opponents' total having lost six wickets (i.e., six of their batters have been dismissed) win
                the match "by four wickets".In all forms of cricket, the umpires can abandon the match if bad
                light or rain makes it impossible to continue. There have been instances of entire matches, even
                Test matches scheduled to be played over five days, being lost to bad weather without a ball
                being bowled, for example, the third Test of the 1970/71 series in Australia.
            </p>

            <h2 class="h2heading">Playing Area</h2>
            <p class="para">In the approximate centre of the field is a rectangular pitch (see image, below) on
                which a wooden target called a wicket is sited at each end; the wickets are placed 22 yards (20
                m) apart. The pitch is a flat surface 10 feet (3.0 m) wide, with very short grass that tends to
                be worn away as the game progresses (cricket can also be played on artificial surfaces, notably
                matting). Each wicket is made of three wooden stumps topped by two bails.</p>
            <div class="img-over">
                <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Cricket_pitch.svg/1920px-Cricket_pitch.svg.png"
                    id="pitch">
            </div>
            <p class="para">The popping crease is drawn four feet in front of the bowling crease and parallel to
                it; although it is drawn as a twelve-foot line (six feet on either side of the wicket), it is,
                in fact, unlimited in length. The return creases are drawn at right angles to the popping crease
                so that they intersect the ends of the bowling crease; each return crease is drawn as an
                eight-foot line, so that it extends four feet behind the bowling crease, but is also, in fact,
                unlimited in length.</p>

            <h2 class="h2heading">Innings</h2>
            <p class="para">
                The innings (ending with 's' in both singular and plural form) is the term used for each phase
                of play during a match. Depending on the type of match being played, each team has either one or
                two innings. Sometimes all eleven members of the batting side take a turn to bat but, for
                various reasons, an innings can end before they have all done so. The innings terminates if the
                batting team is "all out", a term defined by the Laws: "At the fall of a wicket or the
                retirement of a batter, further balls remain to be bowled but no further batter is available to
                come in. In this situation, one of the batters has not been dismissed and is termed not out;
                this is because he has no partners left and there must always be two active batters while the
                innings is in progress.
            </p>

            <h2 class="h2heading">Overs</h2>
            <p class="para">
                The Laws state that, throughout an innings, "the ball shall be bowled from each end alternately
                in overs of 6 balls". The name "over" came about because the umpire calls "Over!" when six balls
                have been bowled. At this point, another bowler is deployed at the other end, and the fielding
                side changes ends while the batters do not. A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs, although
                a bowler can (and usually does) bowl alternate overs, from the same end, for several overs which
                are termed a "spell". The batters do not change ends at the end of the over, and so the one who
                was non-striker is now the striker and vice versa. The umpires also change positions so that the
                one who was at "square leg" now stands behind the wicket at the nonstriker's end and vice versa.
            </p>

            <h2 class="h2heading">Bat And Ball</h2>
            <p class="para">
                The essence of the sport is that a bowler delivers (i.e., bowls) the ball from their end of the
                pitch towards the batter who, armed with a bat, is "on strike" at the other end (see next
                sub-section: Basic gameplay).

                The bat is made of wood, usually Salix alba (white willow) and has the shape of a blade topped
                by a cylindrical handle. The blade must not be more than 4.25 inches (10.8 cm) wide and the
                total length of the bat not more than 38 inches (97 cm). There is no standard for the weight,
                which is usually between 2 lb 7 oz and 3 lb (1.1 and 1.4 kg).

                The ball is a hard leather-seamed spheroid, with a circumference of 9 inches (23 cm). The ball
                has a "seam": six rows of stitches attaching the leather shell of the ball to the string and
                cork interior. The seam on a new ball is prominent and helps the bowler propel it in a less
                predictable manner. During matches, the quality of the ball deteriorates to a point where it is
                no longer usable; during the course of this deterioration, its behaviour in flight will change
                and can influence the outcome of the match. Players will, therefore, attempt to modify the
                ball's behaviour by modifying its physical properties. Polishing the ball and wetting it with
                sweat or saliva was legal, even when the polishing was deliberately done on one side only to
                increase the ball's swing through the air.

            <h2 class="h2heading">Start Learning</h2>
            <p class="para">So after making the big decision the next question which comes to mind is how to start, how
                to learn cricket skills to become an expert. For this you can join your school, college cricket team, a
                local cricket club, or join any state sponsored academy which will help you learn cricket skills. And if

            <h2 class="h2heading">Find your expertise</h2>
            <p class="para">In cricket either you can be an expert in batting, bowling, or fielding. So during the
                initial days of your cricket coaching, try to find out where your expertise and passion lies. If you
                have expertise & passion in batting then put all your focus and energy to hone your batting skills. If
                you are performing best in balling then you should go for balling; and similarly for fielding. And if
                you are an expert in all three skills then you can become a good all-rounder which is also a good option
                for a cricket aspirant. If you are not sure what skills you should focus on then you can take help from
                your cricket coach or mentor who can help you decide what expertise you should focus on. You may also
                find our separate post useful which we have written on cricket batting tips.</p>
